# github-language-rainbow

Github repository language highlighting experiment.

![Colors](https://raw.github.com/geetarista/github-language-rainbow/master/colors.png)

## Disclaimer

These files are not meant to be executed, but just to represent the language with a simple one-line `"Hello, World!"` (or in the case of DCPU-16, 16 lines). I just wanted to see what it looks like when a repository has a ton of languages.

## Todo

* Add more languages
* Add all languages?

## License
