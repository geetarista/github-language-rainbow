# github-language-rainbow

Github repository language highlighting experiment.

## Disclaimer

These files are not meant to be executed, but just to represent the language with a simple one-line `"Hello, World!"`. I just wanted to see what it looks like when a repository has a ton of languages.

## Todo

* Add more languages
* Add all languages?

## License
